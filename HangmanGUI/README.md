# HagmanGUI inspired by [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg) ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEO1B_llDnc), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6cjx7t39d4), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d038LZp_Jhk))

So after i made the CLI version of hangman one my friends asked me to make a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version so i decided to make it since it was gonna teach me more about pygame and GUI in python
